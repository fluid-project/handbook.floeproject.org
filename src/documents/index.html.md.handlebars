The Floe Inclusive Learning Design Handbook is a free Open Educational Resource (OER) designed to assist teachers, content creators, Web developers, and others in creating adaptable and personalizable educational resources that can accommodate a diversity of learning styles and individual needs.

## Who is this for?

This handbook is intended for anyone producing, revising, re-purposing or reusing open education resources (OER) or other forms of digital curriculum.

The tips and advice apply whether you are creating curriculum resources for preschoolers, graduate curriculum or life long learning resources. The handbook also applies whether you are creating simple text-based resources, animations, applets, simulations or full production videos.

In the spirit of OER, if you use this handbook you are also a contributor to this handbook. We welcome all input.


## Why is this important?

Learners learn differently. The goal of education is to support learners in reaching their full potential. While part of the educational process is to challenge learners to facilitate their growth, many learners experience constraints that make it difficult if not impossible to access certain learning resources.

And the impact is profound; the health and prosperity of a society is in large part dependent on equal access to educational opportunities. Inequality and exclusion have devastating social and economic impacts on society as a whole (as well as the excluded individuals). Open education resources are uniquely positioned to have an impact by supporting inclusive education.

Learning outcomes research shows that learners learn best when the learning experience is personalized to their learning needs. Learning breakdown, drop out and lack of engagement in education occurs when students face barriers to learning, feel marginalized by the learning experience offered or feel that their personal learning needs are ignored.

Digital content and digital delivery mechanisms can be harnessed to assist in addressing the diversity of learning needs because of their inherent flexibility. These mutable learning resources can be personally configured, adapted, and shared yielding a greater diversity of learning resources to address the broad range of learning needs.

## Who is currently excluded?

All learners potentially face barriers to learning. These can be seen as a product of a mismatch between the needs of the learner and the learning experience and environment.

Learning needs that affect learning can include:

* sensory, motor, cognitive, emotional and social constraints,
* individual learning approaches or preferences,
* linguistic or cultural preferences,
* technical, financial or environmental constraints.

Some learners are more constrained than others and are therefore less able to adapt to the learning experience or environment offered; for this reason the learning environment or experience must be more flexible.
