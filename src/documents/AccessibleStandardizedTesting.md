This section aims to develop design guidelines for building accessible standardized testing tools for Open Education Resource (OER) authors.

A key feature of accessible standardized testing will be the use of laptops, desktop computers and touch screen tablets/surfaces for delivery of tests and collection of student responses. Traditionally, standardized tests have been altered extensively for students who have disabilities, however, computer-delivered accessible standardized testing aims to minimize these exceptions or special arrangements where possible and provide accommodations and supports to all students who need them without relying on teachers to provide them. Computer-aided standardized testing covers a broad range of tools from automated multiple-choice type questions to the use of media, simulations and virtual laboratory spaces for testing students. Thus where sound, vision, dexterity, the ability to spell words ‘correctly’ and speedy response times can affect the outcome of standardized testing, accessibility issues must also be considered and explored.
