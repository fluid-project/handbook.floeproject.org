title: Semantic Markup in EPUB 3
category: Techniques
---

EPUB 3 books can be created from HTML5, and the same principles for creating well-formed, semantically sound web content apply. For an EPUB 3 author, there are two tools available: [HTML 5 semantic elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element), and [`epub:type`](http://www.idpf.org/accessibility/guidelines/content/semantics/epub-type.php).

HTML 5 semantic markup gives meaning to otherwise anonymous containers or text structures. For example, you can use the `<section>` element to denote changes in topic, or `<aside>` to indicate content that is secondary in importance.

EPUB 3 also provides semantics more suitable for publications. In addition to using HTML 5 semantic markup, you can describe the same HTML 5 markup as being chapters, or as a sidebar.

Here is an example:

```html
<section epub:type="chapter">
   <h1>Chapter 1: At the Start</h1>
    We always start with a good idea.
    <aside epub:type="sidebar">
        In 2013, 9 out of 10 ideas were great.
    </aside>
</section>
```

The "EPUB 3 Content Document" article by Matt Garrish is a great place to start learning about semantics in EPUB 3:  [http://epubzone.org/news/epub-3-content-documents](http://epubzone.org/news/epub-3-content-documents).
