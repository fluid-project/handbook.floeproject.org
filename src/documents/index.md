The Floe Inclusive Learning Design Handbook is a free Open Educational Resource (OER) designed to assist teachers,
content creators, Web developers, and others in creating adaptable and personalizable educational resources that can
accommodate a diversity of learning preferences and individual needs. This is a work in progress and we are constantly
adding more content to this handbook. The information in this handbook is structured in the following sections:

* [Introduction](/introduction.html): Provides an introduction to the handbook and describes who can benefit from using
  it
* [Perspectives](/PerspectivesOverview.html): Contains articles that discuss the main issues related to education and
  inclusive learning
* [Approaches](/ApproachesOverview.html): Provides best practices, guidelines and resources for creating inclusive
  content and learning experiences
* [Techniques](/TechniquesOverview.html): Contains practical tools and techniques to produce inclusive content and
  assess its accessibility
