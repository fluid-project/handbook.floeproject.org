The Floe Inclusive Learning Design Handbook is a free Open Educational Resource (OER) designed to assist teachers, content creators, Web developers, and others in creating adaptable and personalizable educational resources that can accommodate a diversity of learning preferences and individual needs.
This is a work in progress and we are constantly adding more content to this handbook. The information in this handbook is structured in the following sections:

* [Introduction](/introduction.html): Provides an introduction to the handbook and describes who can benefit from using it
* [Perspectives](/PerspectivesOverview.html): Contains articles that discuss the main issues related to education and inclusive learning
* [Approaches](/ApproachesOverview.html): Provides best practices, guidelines and resources for creating inclusive content and learning experiences
* [Techniques](/TechniquesOverview.html): Contains practical tools and techniques to produce inclusive content and assess its accessibility
