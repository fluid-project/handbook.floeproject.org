This article introduces [a set of recommendations](/techniques/45-recommendations-for-3d-printed-audio-tactile-graphic-design/)
which is intended for educators, designers, makers, or others who want to create inclusive materials for a wider range
of students, including and with a greater focus on blind students. Specifically, the recommendations are aimed at
developing audio-tactile graphics that are 3D printed.

The information on these pages won’t make you an expert on the subject, but it will help you understand the process of
planning, producing and using audio-tactile graphics. We encourage you to access the related resources, seek out more
information, and chat with colleagues whenever possible.

## What are audio-tactile graphics?

Audio-tactile graphics are interactive materials that use touch and hearing to inform their users. They are similar to
tactile graphics, with the difference that the interaction takes place through two sensory channels, rather than just
touch. It is an alternative presentation for visual information and, therefore, is accessible to people with visual
impairments, especially to the blind. Some possible applications:

- Art,
- Maps,
- Graphics,
- Architectural representations,
- Teaching materials.

The possibilities are huge! However, the recommendations presented here are aimed at inclusive education.

## Why a 3D printed audio-tactile graphic?

3D printing is a process of creating a three-dimensional physical object from a digital model. It is a suitable
technology for the development of inclusive materials, even more so with the growth of the maker movement, which seeks
to empower the community to create and share their own projects.

A 3D printed audio-tactile graphic is an inclusive material, which has a decentralized production, on a small scale
basis, according to the needs of each one. It can be created within a community, shared digitally and reproduced elsewhere.

## What is the relation of the audio-tactile graphic to inclusive design and education?

3D printed audio-tactile graphics can be great teaching materials not only for blind students but also for a wider range
of students, even those without disabilities. By eliminating barriers to information access, everyone benefits.

These are materials that can be developed with and for the community, produced with low-cost technologies and shared for
free on the web.
